ANN: libgmail 0.0.8 - Gmail access via Python - POP3 Proxy added!

libgmail -- Python binding for Google's Gmail service

<http://libgmail.sf.net/>

The `libgmail` project is a pure Python binding to provide access to
Google's Gmail web-mail service.

The library currently ships with a demonstration utility to archive
messages from a Gmail account into mbox files, suitable for importing
into a local email client.

Also includes a demonstration utility that acts as a SMTP proxy to
allow mail to be sent from any standard mail client that uses SMTP
(e.g. Mail.app, Mozilla etc). (Now handles attachments.)

New demonstration utility acts as a POP3 proxy to allow mail to be
retrieved from any standard mail client that uses POP3 (e.g. Mail.app,
Mozilla etc).

Features demonstration utility to provide access to Gmail message
attachments via a download-only FTP proxy--this allows retrieval of
suitably marked attachments by a standard FTP client. Utilize more
of your Gmail space!

Major changes since 0.0.7:

 *  Fixed login to work again after it was broken by a Gmail change.

 *  Added trash/delete message thread & trash/delete single message
    functionality. (By request.)

 *  POP3 proxy server demo. (By request.)

 *  Added `GmailLoginFailure` exception to enable tidier handling of
    login failures (which could be bad username/password or a Gmail
    change).
