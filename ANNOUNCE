libgmail -- Python binding for Google's Gmail service

<http://libgmail.sf.net/>

The `libgmail` project is a pure Python binding to provide access to
Google's Gmail web-mail service.

The library currently ships with one demonstration utility to archive
messages from a Gmail account into mbox files, suitable for importing
into a local email client.

Major changes since 0.0.3:

 * Can return *all* message threads for a request, not just the first page.
   This means it is possible to archive all your messages with the included
   demo.
 
 * Retrieval of label names.

 * Message retrieval by folder or label.

 * Count of unread messages. 

 * Refactoring & code cleanup.

 * Demos can search by folder name or label name. (Including archival script.)
