ANN: libgmail 0.0.7 - Gmail access via Python - Now with FTP Proxy!

libgmail -- Python binding for Google's Gmail service

<http://libgmail.sf.net/>

The `libgmail` project is a pure Python binding to provide access to
Google's Gmail web-mail service.

The library currently ships with a demonstration utility to archive
messages from a Gmail account into mbox files, suitable for importing
into a local email client.

Also includes a demonstration utility that acts as a SMTP proxy to
allow mail to be sent from any standard mail client that uses SMTP
(e.g. Mail.app, Mozilla etc). (Now handles attachments.)

New demonstration utility to provide access to Gmail message
attachments via a download-only FTP proxy--this allows retrieval of
suitably marked attachments by a standard FTP client. Utilitize more
of your Gmail space!

 * Demo FTP proxy enables marked Gmail message attachments to be
   download via FTP.

    standard mail client via (E)SMTP.
