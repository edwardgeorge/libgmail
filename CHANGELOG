== Version: 0.0.3 (8 July 2004) ==

libgmail.py
 * Allow username to be specified on the command line instead of prompting.
 * Rough special case handling of when more than one set of thread information data is present on a page (seemed to occur when using 'all' search after a certain number of items). TODO: Make this fix work at the page parsing level, but splitting all tuples into individual items.
 * Add cookie handling code to enable us to remove requirement for ClientCookie package. (Especially for Adrian... :-) )

demos/archive.py
 * *Extremely* rough mbox creation--turns out the mails retrieved had '\r' characters at the end of the headers. The mbox file appears to be successfully imported by OS X's Mail.app client.
 * Allow username to be specified on the command line instead of prompting.
